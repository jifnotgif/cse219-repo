/**
 * This class defines a ComputeTask that computes the Mandelbrot set.
 * More precisely, it iterates the formula z = z*z + c, where c ranges over
 * a grid of points in the complex plane, and it determines how many
 * iterations it takes for the value of z to diverge at each point.
 * The points at which divergence does not occur form an approximation to
 * the Mandelbrot set, and for the other points, the iteration numbers at
 * which the divergence threshold is reached can be used to create interesting
 * pictures.
